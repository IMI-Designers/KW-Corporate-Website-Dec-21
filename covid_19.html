                        Dear Ooredoo Family
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It has been over a week now, since the partial curfew was implemented across the country; a
                        decision taken by the Kuwaiti government to protect us and our loved ones from possible
                        consequences. In fact, the COVID-19 is changing everything about our daily life, our daily
                        routine and our businesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As our normal life comes to a halt, telecoms has become one of the key pillars that is holding
                        the world together as people stay at home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this regard, Ooredoo made a set of important commitments to support you, our customers and to
                        support Kuwait as well, since the first days of this global pandemic: </p>
                    <p>
                        Stay Home, Stay Safe, Stay Online: </p>
                    <p>
                        On February 29th, we shared with you preventive steps that are essentially important to face
                        this infectious disease and consider them as part of your daily routine around the
                        workplace. </p>
                    <p>
                        We have announced placing sanitizers in each floor and we made sure workstations are sanitized
                        and desks are disinfected on a daily basis to ensure everyone’s safety. </p>
                    <p>
                        During the lockdown times and during the official holiday, while some of our branches were open
                        for customers, we were committed that all precautionary measures are implemented and executed
                        thoroughly to ensure the well-being of both our customers and employees. </p>
                    <p>
                        On March 22nd, when the government imposed a nationwide curfew, we have continued to operate at
                        full capacity and announced the “Work-from-Home” policy for office-based employees. All of us
                        became focused on enriching our customers’ digital lives during this challenging time to ensure
                        the continuity of service through our digital networks. </p>
                    <p>
                        We made Online orders – through both the website and MyOoredoo App- a priority to us making sure
                        a contactless deliveries are made for the safety of our sales agents and customers as well.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our priorities remain the safety of all our customers wherever they are; encouraging them to
                        stay home, stay safe and stay online. </p>
                    <p>
                        Ooredoo remains “Socially Responsible”: </p>
                    <p>
                        We played an important role in supporting society during this unprecedented time. As the
                        situation progressed, Ooredoo Kuwait was the first telecom operator to offer health workers and
                        Kuwait front liners free internet for a month. </p>
                    <p>
                        Ooredoo – in collaboration with CITRA and the other two operators – announced free daily 5GB
                        internet allowance and free local calls offered to all customers for an entire month starting
                        March 22nd till the 20th of April. </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to that, Ooredoo was present in some quarantine centers to film and document the
                        great efforts done by doctors and nurses in the field. We made sure to also celebrate Mother’s
                        Day with moms working at Jaber Hospital. </p>
                    <p>
                        More community initiatives are in the pipeline as Ooredoo continues its commitment towards the
                        society during these unprecedented times. </p>
                    <p>
                        We are all in this together: </p>
                    <p>
                        We understand these are uncertain times, as the whole world is struggling to fight to return to
                        safety. We are fully committed to ensuring the health, safety, and well-being of our employees.
                        This is our top priority to maintain the business continuity needed and provide the support and
                        service to more than 2 Million of our customers. </p>
                    <p>
                        You may all feel worried at this stage, this is natural and understandable, we may also face
                        some challenges to overcome this crisis, but I am certain, with you as one team and one spirit
                        we will overcome these challenges and return back to our normal business, stronger than before

                        As we face the growing concerns regarding the COVID-19 virus situation in the country, the
                        Council of Ministers have amended the partial nationwide curfew hours from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00
                        a.m. which started today; Monday, April 6, 2020. </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, given that the telecommunications sector is of utmost importance during the current
                        situation, and our vital role in the State of Kuwait and abroad to serve the public interest,
                        and to ensure that we continue to provide our customers with high quality telecommunication
                        services, the Company will continue its implementation of the ‘Work from Home’ strategy until
                        end of day April 23, 2020 which the Company announced through an announcement on March 22, 2020.
